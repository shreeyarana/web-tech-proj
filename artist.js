            <p>Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.</p>
			<p>While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. </p>
			<p>Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.</p>
			<p>Leonardo is among the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance.</p>
			<p>Despite having many lost works and less than 25 attributed major works—including numerous unfinished works—he created some of the most influential paintings in Western art.</p>
			<p>His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon.</p>
			<p>In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.
